### Aditional Versions 
The 0.5 version has the basics and I will accept pull request if it can be made better, I have the finished 1.0 version and currently working on the 2.0 version
I will publicly release the 1.0 when 2.0 is finished<br>

Here are some of the key features of version 1.0:<br>

    &emsp;More accurate tracking up to 99.9% accurate<br>
    &emsp;Stop tracking after 30 days<br>
    &emsp;Better UI with a gif command (/help)<br>

I am also working on version 2.0, which will include even more features such as:<br>
    &emsp;User-specific products and stores<br>
    &emsp;Button scroll display for products<br>
    &emsp;Tracking entire stores<br>
