# Discord Shopify Tracking Bot

(Some of this was written with an AI btw :) )<br>
Welcome to the Discord Shopify Tracking Bot repository! <br>
This bot allows you to track sales and data for your Shopify products and stores, and receive regular updates on their performance.<br>

### Bot
To use the bot, add the following to config.py Mongo Token, Discord Bot Token, Mongo DB name<br>
0.5 Commands<br>
    /track_product - Track a product(s) sales. Requires a product link.<br>
    /check_product_data - Check total sales and data for a specific product. Requires a product link.<br>

Note: If you're tracking a new store, you must first use /track_product.<br>

### Tracker

This tracker will need to run 24/7 in the server. It runs in a while loop with a 30s sleep inbetween, lower sleep times may make mistakes.<br>

### Aditional Versions 
The 0.5 version has the basics and I will accept pull request if it can be made better, I have the finished 1.0 version and currently working on the 2.0 version<br>
I will publicly release the 1.0 when 2.0 is finished<br>


The full version 1.0 of the bot is available for purchase or customization. You can contact us on Discord or create an offer on Fiverr for more information.<br>
Here are some of the key features of version 1.0:<br>
