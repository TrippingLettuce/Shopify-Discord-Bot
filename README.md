    /track_product - Track a product(s) sales. Requires a product link.

### Aditional Versions 
The 0.5 version has the basics and I will accept pull request if it can be made better, I have the finished 1.0 version and currently working on the 2.0 version.
I will publicly release the 1.0 when 2.0 is finished
